## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CONTRIBUTING.md Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and use the blank template.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- If there's an issue compiling the app, provide the xcode version and any other info that may seem relevant.
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and use the issue template.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- As per the template, provide your app version, mac model, macOS version and any other information that may be important.


### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and use the blank template.
- Provide as much detail as you can about the feature you want.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
